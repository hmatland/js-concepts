# Scopes and closures

Scopes and closures has often been confusing for developers. A scope essentially defines which variables you can use/access. A scope is divided into a **global**, and **local scopes**.

Variables exposed in the global scope, will be accessible from within the global scope, and all the other underlying local scopes. However, a variable inside a local scope, will not be directly accessible from another local scope or from the global scope.
