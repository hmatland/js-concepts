# Prototype and inheritance

### What is a prototype?

A prototype can somewhat remind of classes in other languages; inheritance, shared methods, etc. In Javascript, there are only a single primitive prototype; _object_. Every object has a prototype associated with it. You can create an object from another object, in which it inherits its properties and methods. 

### Inheriting a prototype

When you are prototyping, you can access the object itself by the `this` keyword \([read more about it here](untitled.md)\). 

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="Example 1" %}
```javascript
let prototypeObj = {
    x: 5,
    g() {
        console.log(this.x)
    }
}

// Create a new object, which prototypes 'prototypeObj'
let newObj = Object.create(prototypeObj)

newObj.x = 10

// Inherits prototypeObj method
newObj.g()       // Outputs: 10
prototypeObj.g() // Outputs: 5
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

### Prototype chains

When an object is created from another object, it will _inherit_ it's prototype. The prototype itself also inherits from the object it was created from, creating a chain of prototypes.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="Example 2" %}
```javascript
let x = {
  a: 1
}

let y = Object.create(x)
y.b = 2

let z = Object.create(y)
z.c = 3

console.log(z.a, z.b, z.c) // Output: {a: 1}, {b: 2}, {c: 3}

// z object
console.log(z) // Output: {c: 3}

// y prototype
console.log(z.__proto__) // Output: {b: 2}

// z prototype
console.log(z.__proto__.__proto__) // {a: 1}

// Object prototype
console.log(z.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__) // Object methods
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

As you see at line 11, is that you can directly access methods that were inherited, no matter how far down it is in the prototype chain. The interpreter will look deeper down the prototype chain if a method or variable is not present in the main object. This means that you also can override prototype methods inside a object, without affecting the rest of chain. The overridden method/variable will only be available to the object. _Note that this is the case if you don't directly edit the prototype object itself, `.__proto__`._
